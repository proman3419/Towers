# Towers
## Game description
Fill gray cells with towers whose heights range from 1 to the grid size, so that every possible height appears exactly once in each row and column. 
Numbers outside the grid, describe how many towers we can see from that position.
For example with sequence 2,5,3,4,1 we can see 2 towers from left and 3 from right (higher tower covers the other)
